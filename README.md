# My solutions to Project Euler

The Project Euler team explicitly say people should not share their answers:

Q: I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?
<pre>

A: It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" 
moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often 
through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment
too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active
process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. 
Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.

Hence, I won't be posting my answers on Github. If you already solved the questions checked bellow 
and want to discuss them with me, send me an email at p.deltino at gmail dot com.

Currently, I solved the following exercises with Python 3:
